Q1. Data Review (Before Importing)

Steps to review the data before importing:

Check for missing values, duplicates, and data type consistency.

Validate date formats and column headers.

Clean or standardize data using spreadsheet tools before importing into MySQL.

SQL Queries to Execute:

Display all customers from the city 'Delhi'

Count the number of signups in the last 30 days (Assume today = 16th April 2025)

List unique cities where customers are based

List top 3 cities by number of signups

Find customers who have never placed an order, assuming another table orders(customer_id, order_id, amount)
